// Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
// 1. Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.
// 2. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
//  Hint: The depth of the earth can be found as the third coordinate for each earthquake.
// 3. Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
// 4. Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
// 5. Your visualization should look something like the preceding map.
